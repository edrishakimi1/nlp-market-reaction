# Introduction

**NLP Market Reaction** is a research-focused project that explores how financial news sentiment influences short-term stock market behavior. Using modern Natural Language Processing techniques and transformer-based models such as FinBERT, the project extracts sentiment from real financial text (news articles, headlines, reports) and analyzes how this sentiment corresponds with immediate price movements.

Financial markets often react within minutes to new information. Understanding the relationship between news sentiment and short-term returns is important for quantitative finance, algorithmic trading, and risk management. This project provides a reproducible pipeline that connects:

**financial text → sentiment analysis → event-study analysis → market reaction modeling**

The repository includes the full workflow:
- Collecting financial news and price data  
- Preprocessing and cleaning text  
- Applying or fine-tuning transformer-based sentiment models  
- Engineering features for financial prediction  
- Studying market reactions using event-study methods  
- Modeling short-term return direction or magnitude  

This project serves as a practical foundation for research on market efficiency, sentiment-driven strategies, and the interplay between information and price dynamics.
